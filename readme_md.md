# SSH Brute Force Detector

A Python script that monitors SSH authentication logs to detect potential brute force attacks by analyzing failed login attempts.

## Features

- üîç **Real-time Analysis**: Parses `/var/log/auth.log` line by line
- üïí **Time Window Tracking**: Monitors failures within configurable time windows (default: 10 minutes)
- üö® **Alert System**: Triggers alerts when IP addresses exceed failure thresholds
- üìä **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed summaries of suspicious activities
- üõ°Ô∏è **Multiple Attack Patterns**: Detects various SSH failure types:
  - Failed password attempts
  - Failed public key authentication
  - Invalid user attempts
  - Pre-authentication disconnections
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**: Uses compiled regex patterns for fast processing
- üîí **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of permission issues and missing files

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Linux system with SSH logging enabled
- Access to `/var/log/auth.log` (usually requires root privileges)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ssh-brute-force-detector.git
cd ssh-brute-force-detector
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x ssh_detector.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run with default settings (5 failures in 10 minutes):
```bash
sudo python3 ssh_detector.py
```

### Advanced Usage

Customize threshold and time window:
```bash
# Alert after 3 failures in 5 minutes
sudo python3 ssh_detector.py --threshold 3 --time-window 5

# Use custom log file
python3 ssh_detector.py --log-file /path/to/custom/auth.log

# Show help
python3 ssh_detector.py --help
```

### Command Line Options

```
--log-file, -f      Path to auth.log file (default: /var/log/auth.log)
--threshold, -t     Number of failures to trigger alert (default: 5)
--time-window, -w   Time window in minutes to track failures (default: 10)
--version          Show version information
--help             Show help message
```

## Sample Output

```
üìñ Reading log file: /var/log/auth.log
üîç Threshold: 5 failures
‚è∞ Time window: 10 minutes

üö® ALERT: IP 192.168.1.100 has 6 failed attempts!
üö® ALERT: IP 203.0.113.25 has 6 failed attempts!
üö® ALERT: IP 198.51.100.10 has 5 failed attempts!

   SSH-related lines: 156
   Unique IPs with failures: 5

   2024-12-25 10:15:37: Dec 25 10:15:37 ubuntu sshd[12350]: Failed password for ubuntu from 192.168.1.100...
```

## Testing

A sample auth.log file is provided for testing purposes. You can test the script without sudo privileges:

```bash
# Test with sample data
python3 ssh_detector.py --log-file sample_auth.log --threshold 3
```

## How It Works

1. **Log Parsing**: The script reads the auth.log file line by line
2. **Pattern Matching**: Uses regex patterns to identify SSH failure events
3. **Time Window Tracking**: Maintains a sliding window of recent failures per IP
4. **Threshold Detection**: Triggers alerts when IPs exceed the failure threshold
5. **Cleanup**: Automatically removes old entries outside the time window
6. **Reporting**: Provides comprehensive summaries and detailed analysis

## Detected Attack Patterns

The script recognizes these SSH attack indicators:

- `Failed password for [user] from [IP]`
- `Failed publickey for [user] from [IP]`
- `Invalid user [user] from [IP]`
- `Connection closed by authenticating user [user] [IP] [preauth]`
- `Disconnected from [IP] port [port] [preauth]`

## Security Considerations

- **Run with appropriate privileges**: The script needs read access to `/var/log/auth.log`
- **Regular monitoring**: Consider running this script periodically via cron
- **IP whitelisting**: You may want to exclude known good IPs from monitoring
- **Integration**: Consider integrating with fail2ban or similar tools for automated blocking

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied
```bash
# Run with sudo
sudo python3 ssh_detector.py
```

### File Not Found
```bash
# Check if auth.log exists
ls -la /var/log/auth.log

# On some systems, it might be named differently
ls -la /var/log/secure    # CentOS/RHEL
ls -la /var/log/messages  # Some distributions
```

### No SSH Events Found
- Ensure SSH is running and logging is enabled
- Check if SSH events are logged to a different file
- Verify the log format matches expected patterns
